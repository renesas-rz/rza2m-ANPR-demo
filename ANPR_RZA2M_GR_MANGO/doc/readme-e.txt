3. About Sample Code

  These sample code operate as described below:

    DRP Basic Operation Sample Program
      Converts the input image from MIPI camera to grayscale image
      using DRP Library and outputs to display.

    DRP Parallel Operation Sample Program
      Converts the input image from MIPI camera to grayscale image at high speed
      using parallel operation function of DRP Library and outputs to display.

    DRP Dynamic Loading Sample Program 1
      Detects the edges of the input image from MIPI camera
      by Canny method using DRP Library and outputs to display.

    DRP Dynamic Loading Sample Program 2
      Detects the corners of the input image from MIPI camera
      by the Harris corner detector using DRP Library and outputs to display.

    DRP Dynamic Loading Sample Program 3
      After detecting the edges of the input image from MIPI camera
      by Canny method using DRP Library, performs contour detection using findcontours application.
      The results output to display.

    DRP Simple ISP Sample Program 1
      Correct the color and noise of the input image from MIPI camera using DRP Library,
      and the image with high color reproducibility is output to the Display.

    The application program is executed by the loader program after performing the register setting processing of 
    the SPI multi I/O bus controller (SPIBSC) and the serial flash memory by the loader program.
    The loader program is stored in the following folder.
      ["Project name"\bootloader\rza2_qspi_flash_ddr_bootloader.elf]

    This loader program conforms to the specification of Macronix MX25L51245G. When using another serial flash memory, 
    change the source code of the loader program project [rza2m_sflash_boot_loader_gcc] that is included in 
    "RZ/A2M Group Example of Booting from Serial Flash Memory" application note according to the specifications of 
    the flash memory, and then generate the new load module. The project debug configuration uses the loader program
    after changing the file name of the generated load module to "rza2_qspi_flash_ddr_bootloader.elf".


4. Operation Confirmation Conditions

  (1) Boot mode
    - Boot mode 6
      Boot from OctaFlash(SPI mode) connected to OctaFlash space.
      * The program can not be operated if the boot mode except the above is specified.

  (2) Operating frequency
      The RZ/A2M clock pulse oscillator module is set to ensure that the RZ/A2M clocks on the CPU board
      board have the following frequencies:
      (The frequencies indicate the values in the state that the clock with 24MHz
      is input to the EXTAL pin in RZ/A2M clock mode 1.)
      - CPU clock (I clock)                 : 528MHz
      - Image processing clock (G clock)    : 264MHz
      - Internal bus clock (B clock)        : 132MHz
      - Peripheral clock1 (P1 clock)        :  66MHz
      - Peripheral clock0 (P0 clock)        :  33MHz
      - OM_CK/OM_CK#                        : 132MHz
      - CKIO                                : 132MHz

  (3) OctaFlash (connected to OctaFlash space) used
    - Manufacturer  : Macronix Inc.
    - Product No.   : MX25UW12845GXDIO0

  (4) Setting for cache
      Initial setting for the L1 and L2 caches is executed by the MMU. 
      Refer to the "RZ/A2M group Example of Initialization" application note about "Setting for MMU" for 
      the valid/invalid area of L1 and L2 caches.
